# Simple Next.js Chat App

This project is a simple chat application built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. It demonstrates a basic chat UI using React state for messages. There is no backend or real-time functionalityâ€”messages are only stored in the browser session.

## Features
- Modern Next.js setup (App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint)
- Simple chat interface with message list and input box
- All messages are stored in React state (client-side only)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (if not already):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Customization
- To add real-time features or a backend, consider integrating with Socket.IO, Firebase, or a custom API.
- UI is styled with Tailwind CSS and can be easily customized in `src/app/page.js`.
